# Movie-database
This is a group project that was part of my second year at uni and intends to create an interactive webpage with a variety of options to display movie' info

## Description
This tool is to be used to search movies, actors and directors while having the choice to filter out the genre, year or budget. The project is done using ASP.NET programming language paired with SQL database language


## Visuals
Below is a demo of the movie database tool and how it works, illustrating the funcationlaities with the search results.

## Installation

To run the project properly all you need is Microsoft Visual Studio, you can get this software simply by following this [link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). However, I understand the project files are missing as their size is quite large. You can always email me if you ever need to look into them and I will send them somehow.


## Support
If you have any issues with the project and want to get help, or even having an idea to enhance/add something I am always happy to hear from you via emails on : yamenadel4@gmail.com .


## Roadmap
I am planning on enhancing the design of the movie database tool, and making it look more professional.
